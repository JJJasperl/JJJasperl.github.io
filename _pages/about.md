`Actively looking for software engineering positions`

Hello! My name is Jie (Jasper) Liu, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a [Master of Engineering](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/industry-programs/meng/) at the `University of California, Berkeley`, expecting to graduate in May 2025. I hold a [Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-ba/) from UC Berkeley. My academic focus includes user interface design, machine learning, and computer vision. I have strong technical skills in programming languages like Java, Python, and C++, and I am proficient with tools such as Git, Docker, and AWS.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy exploring the vibrant culture and natural beauty of Berkeley, hiking, reading, and traveling whenever I get the chance. I also love working on personal tech projects and participating in hackathons. Feel free to reach out to me at jasperl@berkeley.edu if you'd like to connect or learn more about my work and interests!
